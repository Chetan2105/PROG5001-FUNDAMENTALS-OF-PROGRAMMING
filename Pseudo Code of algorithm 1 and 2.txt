Pseudo Code for Highest and Lowest Marks (Algorithm 1)

Algo 1: Highest and Lowest Marks

Initialize high to -1 and low to 31.
For each mark in the list of students marks:
If the mark is greater than high, update high to this mark.
If the mark is less than low, update low to this mark.
Print high and low.





Pseudo Code for Mean and Standard Deviation (Algorithm 2)
Algo 2:  Mean and Standard Deviation

Mean Calculation:

Initialize total to 0.
For each mark in the list of students marks, add it to total.
Divide sum by the number of students to get the mean.

Standard Deviation Calculation:

Initialize varSum to 0.
For each mark in the list of students  marks:
Calculate the square of the difference between the mark and the mean, then add it to varSum.
Divide varSum by the no. of students to get the var.
Take the square root of var to get the standard deviation.
Print the mean and standard deviation.
